Own Ghost - A deamon that will observe your activities and help you make AI contexts from them

Own Ghost (OG) is a modular, extensible system for self-observation and intelligent reflection. It allows users to register observers—modular plugins that monitor activity across a wide range of sources: GitHub commits, keyboard input, application usage, browser history, and more. Each observer conforms to a shared interface, enabling consistent background tracking and asynchronous, timestamped data collection. These observations are serialized to local files, indexed continuously, and embedded into a vector database—making the full scope of one’s recent activity instantly searchable.

On top of this observation layer, OG adds an intelligent agent capable of interpreting and summarizing behavior. Users can query their history conversationally or receive automated synopses such as “What did I work on yesterday?” or “What projects have I touched this week?” The AI agent doesn’t just retrieve facts; it contextualizes them, helping users understand progress, identify patterns, and stay oriented. The long-term vision includes a live analysis and alerting layer: as activity is being tracked, OG can also think in real time—issuing notifications when a behavioral pattern warrants attention (e.g., deep focus time is broken, a new task context is emerging, or something forgotten resurfaces).

OG acts as a silent partner, a persistent digital witness with memory and insight. It is neither intrusive nor controlling—it observes, thinks, and advises only when asked or when its understanding reaches a threshold of usefulness. The name, Own Ghost, captures this duality: a private, ever-present watcher that remembers what the conscious mind may forget, surfacing only to help its host see themselves more clearly.
